# hand_gesture-air_writing
Hand Gesture Air Writing is a computer vision–based project that allows users to write characters or draw in the air using hand movements, without touching any physical surface. The system uses a webcam to capture real-time video and tracks hand landmarks using libraries like MediaPipe and OpenCV.
